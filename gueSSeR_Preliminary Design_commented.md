[Good start! Let's see what data you can find for cost, head loss as a function of flow, temperature, particle concentration, and plan view area required for membrane and AguaClara StaRS filters.]

## Introduction
Membrane filtration is an up-and-coming type of filtration option for water treatment plants. Membrane filtration is attractive because the pores are small enough to capture small bacteria like Cryptosporidium oocysts [Cryptosporidium are protozoans] and the filter sheets are thin so they can be "stacked" very easily. This is a huge plus for saving space while efficiently filtering out nasty particles.

The goal of our design project is compare the efficiency, cost, and feasibility of membrane filtration to AguaClara's StaRS filters. AguaClara plants are designed with a purpose: to make safe drinking water more accessible to those who cannot afford a traditional drinking water treatment plant. Cost and efficiency of design are important to AguaClara plant design, so our work would reveal whether membrane filtration would be a better alternative to the existing StaRS filter.

## Our Plan
Our plan is use one of [the] AguaClara plant[s] in Honduras as a comparison to the low pressure membrane from PALL.

 We are going to calculate the total material cost of both system ( AguaClara sand filter and PALL membrane), excluding the labor. In this calculation we will need to consider the total area of most efficient and also the lifespan of both system. [Previous sentence isn't clear. Consider other membrane suppliers as well.]

 After comparing the cost, we will then see what is the most economical option to build the system, regardless Honduras at this point maybe do not have access to membrane system which consider very high-tech. We then will get the technical data from PALL so we can compare the turbidity, types of pathogen (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) filtered, and also the flux of the system.

 Lastly, we will compare the average lifespan of the systems assuming both are handled with good maintenance. Collecting the failure of membrane can be a challenger because membrane is considerably new technology. [Previous sentence isn't clear. Membranes have been in use for several decades by now so it should be possible to get good long term performance information. The case study I shared in class is a good example. Hopefully there are more examples that you can find.]



## Important constraints
Plant Flow, Effluent Water Quality, **NO ELECTRICITY**

Membrane Flux, Operational Load, Feed Water Quality, Chemical Cleaning Regime, Preventative Maintenance Program, Pretreatment Process/Chemistry, Cost/Benefit Evaluation at End of Membrane Life [disposal of spent membranes, carbon footprint?]

##Trade-offs
Stack sand filter vs. Membrane filtration

Advantages of Membrane filtration
1. Less influenced by influent water conditions - flow and water quality. Effluent quality is mostly cosntant [constant]
2. Provide a physical barrier against suspended solids, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Bacteria, Colloids, Viruses?
3. Small membrane size allows for creating a geometry that maximizes surface area and is much smaller than stack sand filters. [I tried to point this out in lecture. Membrane footprint is not actually that small. I suggest you visit the Ithaca Water Treatment plant and perhaps take some measurements!]

Disadvantages of Membrane filtration
1. May need a pump for optimal flux/flow
2. Flux depends on temperature and is greatly reduced in low temperatures
3. May require pumping air in for physical backwash and integrity testing
4. Requires chemical backwash - sodium hydroxide/hypochlorite or citric, sulfuric, phosphoric, or hydrochloric acids


## Design alternatives
Membrane filtration is seen by many as an alternative for using flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. They believe that using a membrane filter of a certain pore size will treat water as well as following the processes typically associated with flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration.

[See if you can get data on head loss as a function of turbidity of the raw water. floc/sed removes both particles AND dissolved organics. Membranes will do a poor job of removing dissolved organics. My understanding is that disinfection by products would be a significant problem with membranes if they don't have flocculation first.]

**One possible design alternative is to create a plant that uses only a membrane filtration system in place of the current AguaClara System.**

## Calculations
We are planning to make our calculations for designing the membrane filter to be adaptable to any flow rate needed to be designed for. However, for the purposes of comparing design alternatives, we will be using the Moroceli plant StaRS filter as a baseline for efficiency, cost, and feasibility perspectives.

[Any thoughts on how to take the plant budget and estimate the fraction of the budget that is for the StaRS filter? ]
