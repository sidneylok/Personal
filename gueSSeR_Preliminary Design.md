## Introduction
Membrane filtration is an up-and-coming type of filtration option for water treatment plants. Membrane filtration is attractive because the pores are small enough to capture small bacteria like Cryptosporidium oocysts and the filter sheets are thin so they can be "stacked" very easily. This is a huge plus for saving space while efficiently filtering out nasty particles.

The goal of our design project is compare the efficiency, cost, and feasibility of membrane filtration to AguaClara's StaRS filters. AguaClara plants are designed with a purpose: to make safe drinking water more accessible to those who cannot afford a traditional drinking water treatment plant. Cost and efficiency of design are important to AguaClara plant design, so our work would reveal whether membrane filtration would be a better alternative to the existing StaRS filter.

## Our Plan
Our plan is use one of AguaClara plant in Honduras as a comparison to the low pressure membrane from PALL.

 We are going to calculate the total material cost of both system ( AguaClara sand filter and PALL membrane), excluding the labor. In this calculation we will need to consider the total area of most efficient and also the lifespan of both system.

 After comparing the cost, we will then see what is the most economical option to build the system, regardless Honduras at this point maybe do not have access to membrane system which consider very high-tech. We then will get the technical data from PALL so we can compare the turbidity, types of pathogen (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) filtered, and also the flux of the system.

 Lastly, we will compare the average lifespan of the systems assuming both are handled with good maintenance. Collecting the failure of membrane can be a challenger because membrane is considerably new technology.



## Important constraints
Plant Flow, Effluent Water Quality, **NO ELECTRICITY**

Membrane Flux, Operational Load, Feed Water Quality, Chemical Cleaning Regime, Preventative Maintenance Program, Pretreatment Process/Chemistry, Cost/Benefit Evaluation at End of Membrane Life

##Trade-offs
Stack sand filter vs. Membrane filtration

Advantages of Membrane filtration
1. Less influenced by influent water conditions - flow and water quality. Effluent quality is mostly cosntant
2. Provide a physical barrier against suspended solids, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Bacteria, Colloids, Viruses?
3. Small membrane size allows for creating a geometry that maximizes surface area and is much smaller than stack sand filters.

Disadvantages of Membrane filtration
1. May need a pump for optimal flux/flow
2. Flux depends on temperature and is greatly reduced in low temperatures
3. May require pumping air in for physical backwash and integrity testing
4. Requires chemical backwash - sodium hydroxide/hypochlorite or citric, sulfuric, phosphoric, or hydrochloric acids


## Design alternatives
Membrane filtration is seen by many as an alternative for using flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. They believe that using a membrane filter of a certain pore size will treat water as well as following the processes typically associated with flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration.

**One possible design alternative is to create a plant that uses only a membrane filtration system in place of the current AguaClara System.**

## Calculations
We are planning to make our calculations for designing the membrane filter to be adaptable to any flow rate needed to be designed for. However, for the purposes of comparing design alternatives, we will be using the Moroceli plant StaRS filter as a baseline for efficiency, cost, and feasibility perspectives.
